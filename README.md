1. What is an overcollateralized crypto loan?

An overcollateralized crypto loan is a loan where you must deposit more cryptocurrency as collateral than the amount you want to borrow. For example, if you want to borrow $100 worth of stablecoins, you might need to lock up $150 worth of another cryptocurrency like Ethereum or Bitcoin as collateral.
2. Why do I need to overcollateralize my loan?

Overcollateralization protects lenders. Cryptocurrencies are volatile, meaning their prices can go up or down quickly. By requiring more collateral than the loan amount, lenders reduce their risk in case the value of your collateral decreases.
3. How does overcollateralization work?

Let’s say you want to borrow $100. You’ll deposit $150 of a cryptocurrency as collateral. If the value of that collateral drops significantly, you might need to add more funds to avoid liquidation (selling off your collateral to pay back the loan).
4. What happens if my collateral’s value drops?

If the value of your collateral drops below a certain threshold, the lending platform may “liquidate” some or all of your collateral to pay back the loan. This is how lenders make sure they get their money back even if crypto prices fluctuate.
5. How much collateral do I need for a crypto loan?

The required collateral varies by platform but is often 1.5x or more the value of the loan. This means you might need $150 in collateral for a $100 loan. This ratio is called the collateralization ratio, and it’s often 150% or higher.
6. What happens if my loan is liquidated?

If your collateral is liquidated, the platform will sell some of your collateral to repay the loan. You might still owe fees, and you’ll lose part (or all) of your collateral, depending on how much of it was sold to cover the loan.
7. Can I get my collateral back?

Yes! Once you repay your loan (including any interest or fees), you can withdraw your collateral. If your collateral hasn’t been liquidated, you’ll get back the full amount.
8. Why would someone take an overcollateralized loan instead of just selling their crypto?

People take overcollateralized loans for several reasons:
Tax Efficiency: Borrowing doesn’t trigger a taxable event, while selling crypto might.
Holding Strategy: Borrowers want to hold onto their crypto, expecting its value to increase.
Liquidity Needs: Borrowers can get liquid cash or stablecoins without selling their holdings.
9. Is there interest on overcollateralized loans?

Yes, most platforms charge interest on loans. The rate depends on the platform and type of loan, and it can be fixed or variable.
